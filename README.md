# MathOptimization
This thing are useful to find interesting function values.

All the code and coments were written thinking in brazilian computational modeling or computational science students.

For now, this code only returns maximum values of one dimensional functions.
Was applied an 'menu' that leave the insert of the function by the user and none exceptional condition had brought some error.

If you use this during your studies, please send me some message with feedback.
